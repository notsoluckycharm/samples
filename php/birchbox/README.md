Letâ€™s say you are given an array of n integers, which represents the prices of a stock over n consecutive days. Please write a function in the language of your choice that returns the biggest loss you could incur over those n days by buying high and selling low.


For example: if the array contains |14|1|18|23|12|8|16|, then the biggest possible loss is $15 (buying at $23 and selling at $8).
